# Blanket_Fort

## Description:

This arduino file is for the Blanket_Fort room at Otherworld in Columbus Ohio.
The exhibit fades leds on and off for individuals balls floating
around the room. Each light has it's own starting point (low brightness, high brightness
mid brightness, etc...) and tempo, i.e. some will fade on and off faster than others.
