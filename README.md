## To build:
	
* Place Arduino Library directories in your local arduino library. (check IDE for path)  
    Arduino libraries are custom built, therefore are only included in this repository.  
* Place Processing Library directories in your local processing libraries directory. (check IDE for path)  
    All processing libraries are accessible through the processing IDE.
    Libraries Include:
    
		- Minim  
		- GLVideo  
		- Serial
  
* Place the sketch files in the appropriate sketch location for arduino and processing.  

### Pin Information
For Pin informations check schematic diagrams (not in the repository, contact otherworld),   
or check the setup function or global variables inside the .pde or .ino sketches.
